# USART_INTERRUPT-DRIVER
USART_INTERRUPT DRIVER FOR STM32F411

This program implement a usart driver and usart driver interrupt for STM32f411 based board

It allows not only to send and receive data through uart interface but also 

to generate an interrupt each time a receiving data is detected.

A first sketch could be controlling the rate of toggling a user led through a desired

frequency communicated through usart interface.

The program is developed under keil uvision ,version 5 and it is tested on STM32F411E-DISCO board 

The baud rate = 9600  bps

Clock frequency = 16 Mhz
